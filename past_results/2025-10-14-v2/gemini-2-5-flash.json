      "raw": "To determine the correct direction, let's analyze the features in the street view photo and compare them to the map:\n\n1.  **Mountain and Uphill Road:** The street view photo clearly shows a road ascending gently uphill towards a prominent mountain range in the distance. This is a crucial geographical clue. On the map, looking at the general topography, the land appears to rise towards the northwest (direction C) and northeast (direction A). The southwest direction (B) seems to lead to flatter residential areas for a longer distance. Therefore, the photo is likely taken in direction A or C, facing the mountain.\n\n2.  **Houses and Landmarks:**\n    *   **Street View:**\n        *   On the *left* side of the road, there is a very distinctive white house with a prominent pointed gable roof. It is set back from the road behind a low stone wall.\n        *   On the *right* side of the road, there are utility poles and power lines, with dense foliage and trees obscuring the property behind them.\n\n3.  **Comparing Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A (Northeast):**\n        *   If facing northeast, the left side of the road (northwest side on the map) has a house with a gray roof and solar panels. This does not match the distinctive white house in the photo. The right side (southeast side on the map) has a house with a brown roof and a smaller yard, which doesn't seem to match the densely treed, obscured property on the right in the photo.\n\n    *   **Option B (Southwest):**\n        *   If facing southwest, the left side of the road (southeast side on the map) has a large house with a complex roof and a pool. This does not match the white house. The right side (northwest side on the map) has a gray-roofed house. Also, the photo shows an uphill road to a mountain, which is less likely to be in the southwest direction for this type of topography, compared to A or C.\n\n    *   **Option C (Northwest):**\n        *   If facing northwest (along arrow C):\n            *   **Left side of the road (southwest side on the map):** The map shows a house with a *dark gray* roof. This is a mismatch in color and possibly shape compared to the *white* house with the prominent gable in the street view. However, houses can be renovated or repainted over time.\n            *   **Right side of the road (northeast side on the map):** The map shows a house with a *very light/white* roof and a complex shape. This house has a large front yard area with considerable tree cover, which aligns well with the obscured property, trees, and power poles seen on the right side of the street view photo. The \"light-roofed\" house on the map also has a more complex roof shape which could correspond to the gable on the white house in the photo, but it's on the wrong side.\n\n    *   **Reconciling Discrepancies:**\n        The strongest geographical clue is the road going uphill towards the mountain. This points towards direction C (northwest) or A (northeast).\n        Between A and C, the properties on the right side of the road seem to match better with direction C, specifically the large, treed yard of the light-roofed house on the NE side.\n        The main discrepancy is the distinctive white house on the *left* in the street view versus the dark-roofed house on the *left* (SW side) in the map (if facing C). Given that the map and photo can be years apart, a house renovation (e.g., painting a dark roof white, or significant reconstruction) is a plausible explanation for the color/shape difference if we prioritize the geographical fit and the match of other features.\n\nConsidering the uphill road towards a mountain and the overall layout of the properties on the right side of the street, direction C provides the most consistent match, assuming the house on the left has undergone significant renovation or repainting since the satellite image was taken.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$",
