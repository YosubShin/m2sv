There are three labeled viewpoints (A, B, C).\n    *   **Viewpoint A:** Looks down the hill. The road ahead is relatively straight before a curve. The T-intersection would be behind the camera. This does not match.\n    *   **Viewpoint C:** This is on the side street, looking towards the T-intersection with the main road. The street view is clearly taken from the main road itself, not the side street. This does not match.\n    *   **Viewpoint B:** This viewpoint is on the main road, looking up the hill towards the T-intersection and the curve. The road ahead curves to the left, and a side street (where C is located) joins from the left. On the right corner of the curve, there is a house that corresponds to the light-colored house in the photo. Across the intersection, on the left, is a house corresponding to the one with the reddish-brown elements.

In front of this house is a low wall made of dark stone (likely lava rock). On the left, there is a long, single-story house with a brown exterior and a dark roof, also fronted by a low stone wall. The camera is looking down the length of the street.\n\n*   **Analyze the Overhead Map:** The map shows three labeled directions (A, B, C) originating from a single point on a street.\n    *   The point of origin for the lines is the camera's location.\n    *   The house directly east of the camera's location (at the end of the green line labeled B) has a distinctive roof shape with a large white section, matching the prominent two-story house on the right in the photo.\n    *   The house to the southwest of the camera's location is a long, rectangular building with a dark roof, matching the house on the left in the photo.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Directions:**\n    *   **Direction A:** This view looks northwest along the street. From this perspective, the prominent two-story house would be behind the camera and to the right. The houses immediately visible on the right and left would be different. This does not match the photo.\n    *   **Direction B:** This view looks east, directly at the two-story house. However, the street-view photo is looking *down the street*, not across it directly at a house. So, while it points to a key feature, it's not the correct overall direction of the photograph.\n    *   **Direction C:** This view looks southeast along the street. From this vantage point, the prominent two-story house is on the right side of the road, and the long, dark-roofed house is on the left side of the road. This arrangement perfectly matches the features and their positions in the street-view photo.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The direction shown in the street-view photo corresponds to direction C on the map.\n\nC",

On the immediate left is a corner property with a white wall. On the immediate right is a house with a brownish/grey hip roof and a low concrete retaining wall in the front yard.\n\n*   **Analyze the Overhead Map:** The map shows three labeled directions from a central point.\n    *   Point C is on a corner property that matches the description of the house on the left in the street view photo (a corner lot with what appears to be a wall or fence around it).\n    *   Point A is on the property across the street to the north. This property has a dark roof and a swimming pool in the back. This corresponds to the house seen on the right in the street view photo.\n    *   The viewpoint is at the intersection of the colored lines, at the corner where the street with A and B meets the street with C.\n\n*   **Compare Photo and Map:**\n    1.  The street view is looking along the main north-south street, not down the side street. This eliminates option C as the direction of view. The camera is looking either north (towards A) or south (towards B).\n    2.  The house on the left in the photo is the corner house marked with C. The house on the right in the photo is the house marked with A.\n    3.  Therefore, the camera must be looking north, along the red arrow, in the direction of A.\n    4.  This is further confirmed by observing the houses further down the street. In the photo, the next house on the left (past the corner house) has a dark roof. On the map, looking north from the viewpoint, the house north of C indeed has a dark roof. The street also appears to go uphill towards the top of the map, which matches the photo.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The direction in the street view photo corresponds to looking from the central point towards label A.\n\nA",

On the left side, there is a pickup truck parked next to a house, and further down, a yellow \"DEAD END\" sign is visible at an intersection. Power lines are overhead.\n\n*   **Analyze the Overhead Map and Options:**\n    *   The map shows a residential area with a prominent, large, U-shaped building on the eastern side. This matches the large building in the photo.\n    *   There is a network of narrow alleys between the houses.\n    *   **Direction A (Red Line):** This line points east-northeast along an alley, directly towards the large building. If you are looking in this direction, the large building would be ahead and to your right, which matches the photo. The houses on the left of the alley also match the photo. The red line starts at an intersection with a north-south alley (where the blue line is). The \"DEAD END\" sign seen in the photo is likely for this north-south alley (direction C), which appears to terminate at a fence and grassy area on the map. The sign's placement in the photo (on the left, at the start of the view) is consistent with it being at this intersection, warning traffic about the dead end to the north.\n    *   **Direction B (Green Line):** This line points east along the same alley as A, but from a point further west. From this vantage point, the large building would appear more distant and centered in the view, not prominently on the right side as it does in the photo.\n    *   **Direction C (Blue Line):** This line points north into an alley that clearly dead-ends. However, if you were looking in this direction, the large building would be behind you and to your right, and therefore not visible in the photo. This contradicts the street view image.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The view in the street photo corresponds to the direction indicated by the red line (A).
