From this perspective, the prominent two-story house would be behind the camera and to the right. The houses immediately visible on the right and left would be different. This does not match the photo.\n    *   **Direction B:** This view looks east, directly at the two-story house. However, the street-view photo is looking *down the street*, not across it directly at a house. So, while it points to a key feature, it's not the correct overall direction of the photograph.\n    *   **Direction C:** This view looks southeast along the street. From this vantage point, the prominent two-story house is on the right side of the road, and the long, dark-roofed house is on the left side of the road. This arrangement perfectly matches the features and their positions in the street-view photo.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The direction shown in the street-view photo corresponds to direction C on the map.\n\nC",

The camera is looking either north (towards A) or south (towards B).\n    2.  The house on the left in the photo is the corner house marked with C. The house on the right in the photo is the house marked with A.\n    3.  Therefore, the camera must be looking north, along the red arrow, in the direction of A.\n    4.  This is further confirmed by observing the houses further down the street. In the photo, the next house on the left (past the corner house) has a dark roof. On the map, looking north from the viewpoint, the house north of C indeed has a dark roof. The street also appears to go uphill towards the top of the map, which matches the photo.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The direction in the street view photo corresponds to looking from the central point towards label A.\n\nA",

On the left side, there is a pickup truck parked next to a house, and further down, a yellow \"DEAD END\" sign is visible at an intersection. Power lines are overhead.\n\n*   **Analyze the Overhead Map and Options:**\n    *   The map shows a residential area with a prominent, large, U-shaped building on the eastern side. This matches the large building in the photo.\n    *   There is a network of narrow alleys between the houses.\n    *   **Direction A (Red Line):** This line points east-northeast along an alley, directly towards the large building. If you are looking in this direction, the large building would be ahead and to your right, which matches the photo. The houses on the left of the alley also match the photo. The red line starts at an intersection with a north-south alley (where the blue line is). The \"DEAD END\" sign seen in the photo is likely for this north-south alley (direction C), which appears to terminate at a fence and grassy area on the map. The sign's placement in the photo (on the left, at the start of the view) is consistent with it being at this intersection, warning traffic about the dead end to the north.\n    *   **Direction B (Green Line):** This line points east along the same alley as A, but from a point further west. From this vantage point, the large building would appear more distant and centered in the view, not prominently on the right side as it does in the photo.\n    *   **Direction C (Blue Line):** This line points north into an alley that clearly dead-ends. However, if you were looking in this direction, the large building would be behind you and to your right, and therefore not visible in the photo. This contradicts the street view image.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The view in the street photo corresponds to the direction indicated by the red line (A).

In the distance, the road continues forward. Large trees overhang the road.\n\n*   **Analyze the Overhead Map:** The map shows a major road running diagonally. To the south (bottom part of the map), there is a cluster of large, high-rise buildings, one of which has tennis courts. To the north (top part of the map), the buildings are generally smaller and lower-rise.\n\n*   **Correlate the Photo and Map:**\n    *   The most prominent feature in the photo is the row of high-rise buildings on the right side.\n    *   On the map, these high-rise buildings are located to the south of the main road.\n    *   For the high-rises to be on the right side of the driver, the vehicle must be traveling southeast (from the top-left towards the bottom-right on the map).\n    *   Now let's examine the labeled directions:\n        *   **Direction from A (red line) and Direction from B (green line):** Both of these viewpoints are looking northwest (from the bottom-right towards the top-left). If the photo were taken from A or B, the high-rise buildings would be on the left side of the road, which contradicts the photo.\n        *   **Direction from C (blue line):** This viewpoint is at an intersection, looking southeast down the main road towards points A and B. From this position and direction, the high-rise buildings would be on the right, and the smaller buildings would be on the left. This perfectly matches the arrangement seen in the street-view photo.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The street-view photo was taken from point C, looking in the direction of the blue arrow towards A and B.\n\nC",
