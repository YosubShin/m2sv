A wide road with multiple lanes going straight ahead\n2. Power/utility lines running along and across the road\n3. Commercial buildings on both sides\n4. What appears to be an overpass or elevated structure in the distance\n5. The road continues straight with good visibility\n6. There's a median or center divider with some vegetation\n\nNow looking at the overhead map:\n- Point A (red arrow) points north along the main road\n- Point B (black circle) is to the southeast \n- Point C (blue/cyan arrow) points southwest\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- Direction A (north): This would be looking up the main road. I can see there are commercial buildings on both sides in that direction, including what appears to be warehouses or industrial buildings.\n- Direction B (southeast): This would be looking toward some residential or smaller commercial buildings.\n- Direction C (southwest): This would be looking down another section of road with buildings.\n\nThe key clue is the overpass/elevated structure visible in the distance of the street-view photo. Looking at the map, if we're facing north (direction A), there appears to be infrastructure that could be an overpass further up the road. The wide commercial road with buildings on both sides also matches what we'd see looking north along the main thoroughfare.\n\nThe configuration of buildings - with larger commercial/industrial structures on both sides - best matches the view looking north (direction A).\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{A}",

There are residential houses with driveways and fences\n5. The street appears to be a typical suburban residential road\n\nNow looking at the overhead map:\n- Point A is on the right side, pointing toward what appears to be a major road/highway\n- Point B is on the left side, pointing into a residential area\n- Point C is at the top left, also pointing into a residential area\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- Direction A: This points toward what looks like a major multi-lane road/highway on the right side of the map. This doesn't match the residential street view.\n- Direction B: This points into a residential area with houses visible along the street\n- Direction C: This also points into a residential area\n\nThe key distinguishing feature is that in the street view, I can see the road curving slightly to the left, and there are houses on both sides of a residential street. Looking at direction B, it points along a street that has houses on both sides and appears to curve slightly as it goes into the residential neighborhood. Direction C appears to point more directly up a different street.\n\nThe street view shows a typical residential street with houses, driveways, and utility lines, which matches what we'd expect looking in direction B into the residential neighborhood.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{B}",
