The photo shows an empty lot on the corner. This is a minor discrepancy likely due to the photo and map being taken at different times (e.g., a building was demolished). However, the major features align.\n    *   Looking down the road in direction A leads towards the other side of the river. The presence of high-rise buildings in the distance in the photo is consistent with looking towards a downtown or heavily developed area, which could lie in this direction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate Option B.**\n    *   Facing direction B means looking south-southwest along the river. There is no bridge in this direction. The street view clearly shows a bridge ahead. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate Option C.**\n    *   Facing direction C means looking northwest, away from the bridge. The bridge would be behind the camera. The street view is looking *towards* the bridge. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude.**\n    *   Option A is the only direction that shows the camera facing a bridge with a river and greenery on the right. The major geographical features are a clear match.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",

The white-roofed building seen on the map at the corner appears different in the photo (it's a green house), but this is a common discrepancy due to renovations, different architectural styles visible from the street vs. overhead, or the map and photo being taken years apart.

The camera is positioned at the center of this T-intersection.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the street-view photo.**\n    The photo shows a view looking down a long, straight, two-lane road. The most prominent feature is the house on the left side of the road. It is a long, single-story, light-colored building with a gray roof. The roof has a significant number of solar panels. The facade has distinctive vertical slats. On the right side of the road, there is another house behind a low wall.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate Option A.**\n    Direction A points north into a cul-de-sac. The road in this direction is short and curves. The street-view photo shows a long, straight road. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate Option B.**\n    Direction B points east. Looking east, there are houses on the left (north side). On the right (south side), the map shows a large, empty, grassy lot right at the corner. The street-view photo, however, shows a house immediately on the right, not an empty lot. This is a significant mismatch. While a house could have been built after the map photo was taken, let's check other features. The house on the left in the photo would correspond to the house on the northeast corner of the map. This house on the map has a different shape (more L-shaped) than the long rectangular house in the photo and does not appear to have solar panels.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate Option C.**\n    Direction C points west.\n    *   The view is down a long, straight road, which matches the photo.\n    *   The house on the left in the photo would correspond to the house on the southwest corner of the map. This house on the map is a long, rectangular building with a light-colored body and a gray roof. Crucially, the overhead map view clearly shows dark rectangular shapes on the roof, which are very likely the solar panels visible in the photo. The shape and features of this house are a very strong match for the prominent house on the left in the street view.\n    *   The house on the right in the photo would correspond to the house on the northwest corner of the map. The map shows a house in this position, which is consistent with the photo.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude.**\n    The distinctive house on the left in the street-view photo (long, light-colored, with solar panels) is a clear match for the house located on the southwest corner of the intersection shown on the map. This corresponds to looking in direction C.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{C}",

A very plausible explanation is that the photo is older than the map. At the time the photo was taken, the lot on the right side of the road was undeveloped and covered in trees. Later, the large building (seen on the map) was constructed on that lot.\n    *   This explanation (photo is older than map) resolves the conflicts for view C in a logical way: one building was renovated/rebuilt, and a new building was constructed on a previously wooded lot.

At the entrance to this road, on the left side (from the perspective of the arrow), there is a corner property which matches the location of the \"MOANALUA TERRACE\" sign. The road ahead curves gently to the left, and it is lined with residential houses on both sides. This perfectly matches the features seen in the street-view photo.\n    *   **Option C:** This arrow points northwest into a very short residential street or cul-de-sac.
